<h2>User Journey</h2>

Store Page -> Login -> Checkout

The user will first land on the home store page filled with all the existing products. He can edit the quantity of products he wishes to buy. He can checkout by pressing the top right hand button, which will assess if he is logged in or not. If he is, he will go straight to the checkout page; if not, he will do the login, which only upon a successful attempt would he be redirected to the checkout page. He can also come back to the store page easily by clicking the top left hand corner home button.

<h3>Store Page</h3>
Pay attention to the quantities as shown in the spinner inputs. You will see these numbers again later.

<h3>Individual Product Page</h3>
User can see more details about the product by clicking on its name. The route has been handled for individual pages. Also, the quantity remaining of the product is shown too.

<h3>Login Page</h3>
When user clicks checkout, as he is not logged in, he is redirected to a login page. If he keys wrong info, an error is shown.
