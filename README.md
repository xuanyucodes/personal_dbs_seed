<h2>User Journey</h2>

Store Page -> Login -> Checkout

The user will first land on the home store page filled with all the existing products. He can edit the quantity of products he wishes to buy. He can checkout by pressing the top right hand button, which will assess if he is logged in or not. If he is, he will go straight to the checkout page; if not, he will do the login, which only upon a successful attempt would he be redirected to the checkout page.
